This dataset is the 2017 London list experiment on voter turnout fielded via online YouGov survey of a sample of 3189 Greater Londoners.The main question reads as follows:
\verb{The next question deals with the recent general election on 8th June. Here is a list of four (five) things that some people did and some people did not do during the election campaign or on Election Day. Please say how many of these things you did. Here are the four (five) things:
(1) Discussed the election with family and friends;
(2) (Voted in the election);
(3) Criticised a politician on social media;
(4) Avoided watching the leaders debates;
(5) Put up a poster for a political party in my window or garden.
How many of these things did you do?}
The second item in bracket is the sensitive item.
In addition to the above list, there is a direct question asking about turnout:
\verb{Talking with people about the recent general election on 8th June, we have found that a lot of people didn’t manage to vote. How about you, did you manage to vote in the general election?}
